## My Approach 🧠💡

### 1. Project Setup ⚙️🛠️

- Initialized a React + TypeScript project with Vite for fast and efficient builds  
- Styled components using vanilla CSS for flexibility and simplicity  
- Organized project folders:  
  - `components/` – reusable UI elements  
  - `styles/` – CSS stylesheets  

### 2. API Integration 🔗📡

- Used native Axios package within React’s `useEffect` hook to retrieve skip data  
- Implemented loading and error states to enhance reliability  
- Managed data statefully for dynamic and smooth rendering  

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements 🎨🖌️

- Redesigned layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid for clean, responsive design  
- Developed card-style skip page for intuitive selection  
- Added interactive hover effects for better user engagement  
- Used clear, prominent Call to Action (CTA) buttons  

### 4. TypeScript & Code Quality ✅📜

- Defined strict TypeScript interfaces for API data and component props  
- Structured modular, reusable components to ensure maintainability  
- Followed React best practices for clean, readable code
