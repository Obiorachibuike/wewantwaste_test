My Approach 🧠💡

1. Project Setup ⚙️🛠️

Initialized React + TypeScript project with Vite for fast build

Styled with vanilla CSS for flexibility

Organized structure:

components/ – reusable UI parts

services/ – API integration logic

styles/ – CSS files



2. API Integration 🔗📡

Used fetch inside useEffect to load skip data

Managed loading and error states gracefully

Stored data in React state for dynamic rendering


3. UI/UX Enhancements 🎨🖌️

Redesigned layout using Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness

Created card-style UI for skip page to enhance clarity

Added hover effects for better interactivity

Clear Call to Action (CTA) buttons for easy navigation

Fully mobile and desktop responsive design


4. TypeScript & Code Quality ✅📜

Used strict TypeScript interfaces for API data and props

Modularized components for clean, maintainable code

Followed React best practices for readability and reusability
